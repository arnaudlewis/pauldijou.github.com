project_description: "I was ask by a small association from a small town to help them to make a website to organize events. I was young at that time and, even if it was near some exams, I take a lot of time (like maybe 2 or 3 days) to do it. This project is just to say that yes, I did PHP on the past (and still do it from time to time)"
