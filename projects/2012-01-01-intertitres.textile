h2. Intertitres, Natixis and the Sphinx

As stated in "their site":http://www.intertitres.natixis.com/, Intertitres is specialized in selling securities like *Chèque de Table®* or *CESU Domalin®* which are widely used in France by companies. Since they are mostly selling over the web, they have several applications providing all required interfaces for customers to pass their orders. But Intertitres is mostly composed of managers and sellers. All technical stuff and development are delegated to *CELAD*, the IT firm where I was working. My team was dedicated to Intertitres.

Since Intertitres is a subsidiary of Natixis, they have to use the internal tools provided by the IT department of Natixis, and since we were doing the grunt coding for Intertitres, we had to use those tools too. There was a lot of stuff, including Dimension for CSV, Lotus for sharing specifications, RSA (the IBM version of Eclipse) as IDE, Websphere as application server,... But the most important one was Sphinx.

*Sphinx* is the internal framework provided by the R&D department of Natixis. We could compare it to Grails in some points. Its goal is to provide a common stack of frameworks and good practices to all Natixis Java EE applications so it would be easier to maintain and upgrade them. It is built in top of *Seam 2.x*, *Spring* and *Hibernate* for all business logic and *JSF* and *RichFaces 3.x* for user interfaces, with custom composite components. The good practices are about how to handle conversations in Seam in a generic way, or having util Java classes to handle pagination for example (like in the Seam Application Framework). In my opinion, it is a very good product and make all teams more productive but in the same time, it is one more level of abstraction, hiding a bit more the real deal in Java EE 5. Another good point: we had access to the source code and there was a lot to learn from it.

h2. Back-office

Since I had developed it, my first mission was to maintain and add new features to *Back-office*, an administration application which allow users to customize and monitor all others Intertitres' applications. It was mostly a CRUD over specific data and admin operations for Intertitres' managers. Here are a few screenshots of the application:

<div id="boScreenshots" class="carousel slide" style="max-width: 1008px;">
  <div class="carousel-inner">
  	<div class="item active">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/login.PNG" alt="Login page" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Login page</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/utilisateurs.PNG" alt="Users" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Users</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/editUtilisateur.PNG" alt="User edit" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>User edit</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/gestionnaires.PNG" alt="Managers" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Managers</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/detailGestionnaire.PNG" alt="Manager detail" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Manager detail</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/editEmail.PNG" alt="Manager edit mail" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Manager edit mail</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/histoCommandes.PNG" alt="Orders" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Orders</h4></div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/addOperation.PNG" alt="Add operation" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Add operation</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/messages.PNG" alt="Messages" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Messages</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/backoffice/produits.PNG" alt="Products" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Products</h4></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <a class="carousel-control left" href="#boScreenshots" data-slide="prev">&lsaquo;</a>
  <a class="carousel-control right" href="#boScreenshots" data-slide="next">&rsaquo;</a>
</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  $('#boScreenshots').carousel({
    interval: #{site.carousel_interval}
  });
</script>

h2. Eole

After that, with two other members of the team, we developed a brand new application targeting dedicated to small companies and named *Eole*. Here, customers could pass orders for all kind of securities with an easy process compare to the applications dedicated to big companies. The goal was to really ease the process in order to attract companies which only need a few dozens of securities (compare to thousands for big companies) and didn't want to have an headache at each order.

h2. CDT and CESU

Finally, I did some maintenance and design recast on *CDT* and *CESU*, the two main applications targeting big companies with heavy tooling and each one dedicated to a particular security. Here are a few screenshots of *CDT*:

<div id="cdtScreenshots" class="carousel slide" style="max-width: 1008px;">
  <div class="carousel-inner">
  	<div class="item active">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/cdt/login_old.PNG" alt="Login page" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Login page</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/cdt/home_old.PNG" alt="Home page" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Home page</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/cdt/searchBenef_old.PNG" alt="Users" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Users</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/cdt/createBenef_old.PNG" alt="User creation" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>User creation</h4></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item">
      <img src="#{site.projects_assets_url}/cdt/structure_old.PNG" alt="Company structure" />
      <div class="carousel-caption"><h4>Company structure</h4></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <a class="carousel-control left" href="#cdtScreenshots" data-slide="prev">&lsaquo;</a>
  <a class="carousel-control right" href="#cdtScreenshots" data-slide="next">&rsaquo;</a>
</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  $('#cdtScreenshots').carousel({
    interval: #{site.carousel_interval}
  });
</script>
