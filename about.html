        Hi there! My name is <code>Paul Dijou</code> and I'm a web developer interested in anything that is both new and cool in this world. Like lots of people, I'm an open-source advocate, I use OSS every day and it's like eating cookies with peanut butter and whipped cream and ice cream without getting fat (== awesome).

        Recently, I'm trying to contribute. Time for payback! You can follow my pull requests on <a href="https://github.com/pauldijou">my Github page</a>.

        More personnaly, I'm French. It probably explains why there might be quite some English mistakes on my blog. For all English native speakers, I'm really sorry about that. Be sure I do my best to improve my skills. When I have lot of free time (like twice a year), I enjoy taking photos, traveling and skiing (best sport ever).

        Under is my social world. Feel free to plug in any of those.

      <h2>About the website</h2>
      <p>
        The website code is generated by using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> which is a real awesome tool. If you want a generator engine for HTML website and you are not afraid by a bit of Ruby code, you need to give it a try!
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole site is hosted at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> in a <a href="https://github.com/pauldijou/pauldijou.github.com">Git repo</a>. The <code>master</code> branch contains the generated code you are currently seeing in your browser, the <code>develop</code> branch contains the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> code in order to generate this code. For more info about hosting a website on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, read <a href="http://help.github.com/pages/">GitHub Pages help</a>.
