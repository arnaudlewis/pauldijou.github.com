        Hi there! My name is
        %code Paul Dijou
        and I'm a Java EE developer interested in anything that is both new and cool in this world (currently, it's CDI, DeltaSpike, JSF 2.2, HTML5, ...). Like lots of people, I'm an open-source advocate, I use OSS every day (big fan of most of JBoss and Apache projects).
      %p
        Recently, I'm trying to contribute. Time for payback! You can follow my pull requests on
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/pauldijou"} my GitHub page.
        I'm mainly working on
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/richfaces"} RichFaces
        right now and making some translations for
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/arquillian"} Arquillian
        when I have free time, but
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/agorava"} Agorava
        is on my planning and I didn't have loose hope to code something for
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/deltaspike"} DeltaSpike
        one day.
      %p
        More personnaly, I'm French and so I love cheese... I mean, real cheese! That's also explain why there might be quite some English mistakes on my blog. For all English native speaker, I'm really sorry about that. Be sure I do my best to improve my skills. When I have lot of free time (like twice a year), I enjoy taking photos and skiing.
      %p
        Under is my social world. Feel free to plug in any of those.

        About the website
      %p
        The core design is powered with
        %a{:href=>"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html"} Twitter Boostrap.
        Thanks to it, this website is fully responsive on any device and has a great look. There is also inspiration from
        %a{:href=>"http://line25.com/"} Line25
        for the title style.
      %p
        The website code is generated by using
        %a{:href=>"http://awestruct.org/"} Awestruct
        which is a real awesome tool. If you want a generator engine for HTML website and you are not afraid by a bit of Ruby code, you need to give it a try! Lots of inspiration from
        %a{:href=>"http://arquillian.org"} Arquillian website
        which is also build using
        %a{:href=>"http://awestruct.org/"} Awestruct
        but with some many hand-made functionnalities.
      %p
        The whole site is hosted at
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/"} GitHub
        in a
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/pauldijou/pauldijou.github.com"} Git repo.
        The
        %code master
        branch contains the generated code you are currently seeing in your browser, the
        %code develop
        branch contains the
        %a{:href=>"http://awestruct.org/"} Awestruct
        code in order to generate this code. For more info about hosting a website on
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/"} GitHub
        , read
        %a{:href=>"http://help.github.com/pages/"} GitHub Pages help.
