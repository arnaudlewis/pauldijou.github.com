          Hi guys!
        %p So
        .clearfix
          = partial("social-icons.html.haml")
      
    .span6
      .well
        %h6 About the website
        %p
          The core design is powered with 
          %a{:href=>"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html"} Twitter Boostrap.
          Thanks to it, this website is fully responsive on any device and has a great look. There is also inspiration from 
          %a{:href=>"http://line25.com/"} Line25 
          for the title style.
        %p
          The website code is generated by using 
          %a{:href=>"http://awestruct.org/"} Awestruct 
          which is a real awesome tool. If you want a generator engine for HTML website and you are not afraid by a bit of Ruby code, you need to give it a try! Lots of inspiration from 
          %a{:href=>"http://arquillian.org"} Arquillian website 
          which is also build using 
          %a{:href=>"http://awestruct.org/"} Awestruct 
          but with some many hand-made functionnalities.
        %p
          The whole site is hosted at 
          %a{:href=>"https://github.com/"} GitHub
          in a 
          %a{:href=>"https://github.com/pauldijou/pauldijou.github.com"} Git repo. 
          The 
          %code master 
          branch contains the generated code you are currently seeing in your browser, the 
          %code develop 
          branch contains the 
          %a{:href=>"http://awestruct.org/"} Awestruct 
          code in order to generate this code. For more info about hosting a website on 
          %a{:href=>"https://github.com/"} GitHub
          , read 
          %a{:href=>"http://help.github.com/pages/"} GitHub Pages help.
