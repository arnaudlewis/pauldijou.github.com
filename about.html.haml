        Hi there! My name is
        %code Paul Dijou
        and I'm a web developer interested in anything that is both new and cool in this world. Like lots of people, I'm an open-source advocate, I use OSS every day and it's like eating cookies with peanut butter and whipped cream and ice cream without getting fat (== awesome).
      %p
        Recently, I'm trying to contribute. Time for payback! You can follow my pull requests on
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/pauldijou"} my Github page.

        More personnaly, I'm French. It probably explains why there might be quite some English mistakes on my blog. For all English native speakers, I'm really sorry about that. Be sure I do my best to improve my skills. When I have lot of free time (like twice a year), I enjoy taking photos, traveling and skiing (best sport ever).
      %p
        Under is my social world. Feel free to plug in any of those.

      %p
        The website code is generated by using
        %a{:href=>"http://awestruct.org/"} Awestruct
        which is a real awesome tool. If you want a generator engine for HTML website and you are not afraid by a bit of Ruby code, you need to give it a try! Lot of inspiration from
        %a{:href=>"http://arquillian.org"} Arquillian website
        which is also built using
        %a{:href=>"http://awestruct.org/"} Awestruct
        but with some many hand-made features.
      %p
        The whole site is hosted at
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/"} GitHub
        in a
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/pauldijou/pauldijou.github.com"} Git repo.
        The
        %code master
        branch contains the generated code you are currently seeing in your browser, the
        %code develop
        branch contains the
        %a{:href=>"http://awestruct.org/"} Awestruct
        code in order to generate this code. For more info about hosting a website on
        %a{:href=>"https://github.com/"} GitHub
        , read
        %a{:href=>"http://help.github.com/pages/"} GitHub Pages help.
